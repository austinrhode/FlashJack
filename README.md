## What is Flashjack?

Flashjack is a website where users can learn and practice basic strategy for blackjack. The are ~280 unique combinations of dealer upcard and player cards that can learn to be prepared for anything that happens in blackjack. For example, if the dealer is showing a 10, and you have and you have two cards that add to 11, what should you do? Flashjack seeks to allow the user to go through these scenarios over and over again until they become second nature. The site is meant to be minimalistic, so the user can focus on going through as many scenarios as they can as fast as possible. This is the reason behind the fast animation speed and lack of "flashiness" that you would expect from a casino game, because it's not meant to be a casino game. It is a meant that to be a tool that allows you to learn blackjack basic strategy, test your knowledge, and practice.
